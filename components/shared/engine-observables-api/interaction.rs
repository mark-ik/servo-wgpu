/// source for both the cascade and the queries.
///
/// CSS scoping is applied when the snapshot is resolved to element state:
/// `:hover` / `:active` match the target *and its ancestors* (you hover a
/// button by hovering its label), `:focus` matches only the focused element,
/// and `:focus-within` matches the focused element and its ancestors.
