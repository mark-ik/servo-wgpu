//! Backend-neutral rendering-context contract.
//!
//! Post-cut (2026-05-05): the GL/surfman corpus is gone. The legacy
//! `RenderingContext` trait and `GlCapability` capability are deleted;
//! `WgpuCapability` is the only capability and `WgpuRenderingContext`
//! is the only concrete impl. Future window/offscreen rendering
//! contexts implement [`RenderingContextCore`] + [`WgpuCapability`].
